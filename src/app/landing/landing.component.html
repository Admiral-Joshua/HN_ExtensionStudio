            <p>The Extension Studio is a quick and easy way to get started with your Hacknet Extensions.<br />Designed
                from the ground up to utilize a RESTful API and a strong relational database, to provide you with an
                easy start-up.<br /> With linking support
                between <b>Missions</b>, <b>Emails</b>, <b>Board Postings</b>, <b>Actions</b>, <b>Computers</b> and
                their security and much <b>more!</b><br />Whilst we don't have any intentions of
                <i>completely</i>replacing good ol' fashioned coding (though
                it's in theory possible) we hope to make your life easier a bit easier with getting your extension
                started.</p>
            <br /><br />Site Status: <b style="color: gold;">Partially Available</b> -> Some features, such as:
            <b>action
                sets</b>, <b>Themes</b> and <b>compilation to XML</b> are still in development, but you can now largely
            create your own
            extension.

            <p>Sadly we're still working on our UI editor but we're excited to tell you about our server
                back-end.<br />Whilst perhaps not as exciting for some we've really made an effort to utilize OpenAPI
                v3.<br />This provides us with a framework that we
                can publicly make available for anyone to develop a user interface for! If you're not familiar with
                RESTful API services then we can't really help you <b>just</b> yet!<br /><br />But if you are, and want
                to get started, check out the docs
                here!</p>
